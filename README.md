jQuery UI - Interactions and Widgets for the web
jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of jQuery. Whether you're building highly interactive web applications, or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice.

If you want to use jQuery UI, go to jqueryui.com to get started, jqueryui.com/demos/ for demos, api.jqueryui.com for API documentation, or the Using jQuery UI Forum for discussions and questions.

If you want to report a bug/issue, please visit bugs.jqueryui.com.

If you are interested in helping develop jQuery UI, you are in the right place. To discuss development with team members and the community, visit the Developing jQuery UI Forum or #jqueryui-dev on irc.freenode.net.
